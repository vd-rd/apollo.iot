### Motivation
The Apollo IOT platform is designed to provide the basic building blocks of a variety of connected embedded devices. The key features are:
 * small footprint (most boards are under 80x40mm)
 * multiple processor choices
 * open source hardware and software
 * low power consumption
 * flexible power sources
 * multiple communication choices
There are three standard form factors:
 * 40x40mm 
 * 40x60mm 
 * 40x80mm
There are three board types that are implemented:
 * SBC - Processor equipped board with more processing power
 * Node - Processor equipped board with light processing power and low power consumption
 * Cape - Usually a passive board that is used togheter with a SBC or node
 
 ### Hardware
 A board may contain several features but a minimum of hardware features is needed to ensure the proper functionality.
  * One MicroUSB for power and communications
  * One microSD card for logging and/or firmware
  * A RGB LED for status and diagnostics
  * A connector as deffined in the Interconnect section
